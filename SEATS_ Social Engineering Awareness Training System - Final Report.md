# SEATS: Social Engineering Awareness Training System - Final Report

## Executive Summary

The Social Engineering Awareness Training System (SEATS) has been successfully implemented according to the requirements specified in the course work document. This web-based platform provides organizations with a structured approach to educate employees about social engineering threats and test their awareness through interactive modules.

The system includes all requested features:
- User authentication and role-based access control
- Interactive training modules on social engineering topics
- Multiple-choice assessments with configurable passing thresholds
- Progress tracking for employees and administrators
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics

All components have been thoroughly validated and are ready for deployment.

## Implementation Overview

### Requirements Analysis

The implementation began with a thorough analysis of the requirements specified in the course work document. Key findings included:

- The need for a lightweight, web-based solution focused on social engineering awareness
- Requirements for both employee and administrator interfaces
- The importance of contextualized training content
- The need for progress tracking and reporting capabilities

### System Architecture

Based on the requirements, a three-tier architecture was designed:
1. **Presentation Layer**: User interfaces built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap
2. **Application Layer**: Business logic implemented in PHP
3. **Data Layer**: MySQL database for persistent storage

The architecture supports all required functionalities while maintaining a lightweight implementation suitable for small to medium-sized organizations.

### Implementation Details

The system was implemented using the following technologies:
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- **Backend**: PHP 8.x
- **Database**: MySQL 8.x
- **Additional Libraries**: jQuery, Chart.js, Bootstrap Icons

Key components implemented include:
- Secure authentication system with password hashing
- Role-based access control (employee vs. admin)
- Module and lesson management system
- Quiz creation and assessment system
- Progress tracking for modules and lessons
- Reporting and analytics dashboard

### Validation Results

Comprehensive validation testing was performed across all system components:
- Authentication and access control
- Admin functionality (user, module, lesson, and quiz management)
- Employee functionality (module access, lesson interaction, quiz taking)
- System performance and responsiveness
- Security features
- Content accuracy
- Component integration

All validation tests passed successfully, confirming that the system meets all specified requirements and is ready for deployment.

## Deliverables

The following deliverables are included in this submission:

1. **System Package**: Complete source code and database schema (`seats_system.zip`)
2. **User Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for both employees and administrators (`seats_documentation.md`)
3. **Validation Results**: Detailed results of all validation tests (`validation_results.md`)
4. **System Architecture**: Technical documentation of the system design (`system_architecture.md`)

## Installation and Deployment

The system can be deployed by following these steps:
1. Extract the `seats_system.zip` file to your web server
2. Create a MySQL database and import the `database.sql` file
3. Configure the database connection in `config/config.php`
4. Access the system through a web browser
5. Log in with the default admin credentials (Email: `admin@example.com`, Password: `admin123`)
6. Change the default password immediately

Detailed installation instructions are provided in the user documentation.

## Conclusion

The Social Engineering Awareness Training System (SEATS) has been successfully implemented according to all specified requirements. The system provides a comprehensive solution for organizations to educate their employees about social engineering threats and test their awareness through interactive modules.

The lightweight, web-based implementation makes it accessible for organizations of all sizes, while the contextualized training approach ensures relevance to specific organizational workflows and vulnerabilities.

All deliverables have been provided, and the system is ready for deployment.
